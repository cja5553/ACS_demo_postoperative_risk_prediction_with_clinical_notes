## Overview

ClinicalPLAN (*Clinical **P**ostoperative Risk Prediction with **L**anguage Models **A**dapting to Clinical **N**otes*) is a Python package for predicting postoperative risks from clinical notes using language models. It provides flexible and clinically oriented workflows that support a range of perioperative use cases, enabling clinicians, researchers, and healthcare institutions to train and fine-tune models using preoperative or intraoperative clinical text.

The package is designed to be accessible to a broad range of users, including clinicians, surgeons, and researchers with limited programming experience. It minimizes the need to interact with lower-level machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch. With just a few lines of high-level functions, users can begin training and fine-tuning their own models.

ClinicalPLAN supports multiple modeling strategies, including:

1. **Direct inference** with fine-tuned language models  
2. **Semi-supervised learning** approaches for leveraging partially labeled data  
3. A **multi-task learning framework** that enables simultaneous prediction of multiple postoperative outcomes  

The package was developed for the American College of Surgeons (ACS) workshop, *AI for Clinicians and Surgeons: A Hands-On Introduction Across the Care Continuum*.

## Installation

```bash
pip install clinicalplan
```

Because `torch` CUDA wheels aren't hosted on PyPI, install PyTorch first matching your GPU's CUDA version, then install this package. For example, on a machine with CUDA 11.8 drivers:

```bash
pip install torch==2.1.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install clinicalplan
```

**Python version**: 3.9–3.11 (tested on 3.11).

## Quick example

```python
import pandas as pd
from MultiTaskLearningPrediction import mtl_finetune, get_postoperative_outcome_scores

df = pd.read_csv("my_clinical_data.csv")
# df columns: "text", "Outcome_1", "Outcome_2", "Outcome_3", "Outcome_4"

# 1. Fine-tune
mtl_finetune(
    df,
    text_col="text",
    outcome_cols=["Outcome_1", "Outcome_2", "Outcome_3", "Outcome_4"],
    output_dir="my_finetuned_model",
)

# 2. Score a new scenario
scores = get_postoperative_outcome_scores(
    "my_finetuned_model",
    "total knee arthroplasty"
)
# {'Outcome_1': 0.12, 'Outcome_2': 0.28, 'Outcome_3': 0.04, 'Outcome_4': 0.39}
```

## API reference

### `MultiTaskLearningPrediction`

Multi-Task Learning (MTL) allows you to train a single versatile model capable of predicting multiple postoperative outcomes from the same clinical notes. Unlike traditional finetuning strategies — where you'd need to train a single model for each outcome — MTL allows you to create a model capable of simultaneously predicting multiple risks — analogous to foundation models.

**Example**  

```python
mtl_finetune(
    df,
    text_col="clincal_notes",
    outcome_cols=["death_30d", "dvt", "pneumonia", "aki", "AUR", "PE"],
    output_dir="my_run",
    training_configs={
        "num_train_epochs": 3,
        "per_device_train_batch_size": 16,
        "evaluation_strategy": "steps",
        "eval_steps": 100,
        "logging_steps": 100,     
        "learning_rate": 2e-5
        }
)
```

Fine-tune Bio+ClinicalBERT on MLM jointly with one binary classification head per outcome.

**Parameters**

- `df` (`pandas.DataFrame`, *required*): Must contain `text_col` and all `outcome_cols`.  
- `text_col` (`str`, *required*): Name of the free-text column.  
- `outcome_cols` (`list[str]`, *required*): Names of binary (0/1) outcome columns. One auxiliary head is trained per outcome. Rows with NaN in a given outcome are dropped for that outcome's task but used for the others.   
- `output_dir` (`str`, default `"mtl_finetuned"`): Directory to save the fine-tuned model, tokenizer, and metadata. Also used as the HuggingFace Trainer `output_dir` for checkpoints and logs.  
- `base_model` (`str`, default `"emilyalsentzer/Bio_ClinicalBERT"`): HuggingFace model id to start from. Any BERT-architecture model should work.  
- `max_length` (`int`, default `512`): Token sequence length for tokenization.  
- `lambda_constant` (`float`, default `2`): Weight on the auxiliary (per-outcome BCE) loss relative to MLM loss. Total loss = MLM + λ · mean(per-task BCE).   
- `val_fraction` (`float`, default `1/8`): Fraction of `df` held out for validation during training.  
- `training_configs` (`dict | None`, default `None`): Any keyword arguments accepted by `transformers.TrainingArguments`. User-provided values override the defaults below.  Default `training_configs` is `{"num_train_epochs": 5, "per_device_train_batch_size": 24, "per_device_eval_batch_size": 24, "learning_rate": 1e-5, "warmup_ratio": 0.06, "weight_decay": 1e-3, "logging_steps": 1000 "save_strategy": "epoch", "seed": 42,}`




**Returns**

`str` — the `output_dir` path. After training, this directory contains:

- `pytorch_model.bin` (or `model.safetensors`) — model weights
- `config.json` — model architecture config
- `tokenizer.json`, `vocab.txt`, `tokenizer_config.json`, `special_tokens_map.json` — tokenizer
- `mtl_metadata.json` — records `outcome_cols`, `text_col`, `max_length`, `base_model`, `lambda_constant`, `num_tasks` so inference can recover them automatically
- `checkpoint-*` — per-epoch training checkpoints (can be deleted after training)
- `logs/` — TensorBoard-compatible training logs

### `get_postoperative_outcome_scores`



Score a text scenario (or list of scenarios) against each auxiliary head of a fine-tuned MTL model.

**Example**

```python
get_postoperative_outcome_scores(
    model_name,
    text,
    outcomes=["death_30d", "dvt", "pneumonia", "aki", "AUR", "PE"],
)
```


**Parameters**

- `model_name` (`str`, required): Path to a directory saved by `mtl_finetune`.
- `text` (`str | list[str]`, required): One scenario string, or a list of them. Determines the shape of the return value.
- `outcomes` (`list[str] | None`, default: `None`): Which outcomes to score. Defaults to all outcomes the model was trained on, recovered from `mtl_metadata.json`. Pass a subset to score only some. Names must match those used in `mtl_finetune`.
- `max_length` (`int | None`, default: `None`): Token sequence length. Defaults to the value used during fine-tuning, recovered from metadata, otherwise `512`.
- `device` (`str | None`, default: `None`): `"cuda"`, `"cpu"`, or `None` to auto-detect.


**Returns**

- `dict[str, float]` when `text` is a string — maps each outcome name to a probability in `[0, 1]`.
- `list[dict[str, float]]` when `text` is a list — one dict per input, in the same order.
